# TrackRig

TrackRig is a web-based workstation and component tracking system built for places such as factories, internet cafés, computer labs, or workshops. It helps users organize workstations, track physical components, manage assignments, and monitor maintenance tasks.

The goal of the project is to make equipment management easier by keeping all workstation, component, assignment, and maintenance data in one system.

## Main Features

* User registration and login with JWT authentication
* Role-based access for `EMPLOYEE`, `MANAGER`, and `OWNER`
* Workstation management with status and grid/floor position tracking
* Component management with categories, statuses, and workstation assignment
* Component assignment history with active and previous assignments
* Maintenance types and logs
* Maintenance status tracking for due, overdue, and never-completed tasks

---

## Technologies Used

### Backend

* Java
* Spring Boot
* Spring Web
* Spring Security
* JWT authentication
* Spring Data JPA
* Hibernate
* PostgreSQL

### Database

* PostgreSQL relational database
* Tables for users, workstations, components, assignment logs, and maintenance
* Database constraints for safer data handling
* SQL view for maintenance status calculation

---

## Spring Implementation

The backend is implemented as a Spring Boot REST API.

### Spring Web

Spring Web is used to expose REST endpoints through controller classes. Each main module has its own group of endpoints, such as authentication, users, workstations, components, assignments, and maintenance.

### Spring Security and JWT

Spring Security protects the API. Users log in through the authentication endpoint and receive a JWT token. Protected endpoints require the token in the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

User roles are used to control access to specific actions. For example, only an `OWNER` can manage all users.

### Spring Data JPA and Hibernate

Spring Data JPA is used to communicate with the PostgreSQL database. Entities represent database tables, repositories handle database queries, and services contain the main business logic.

Hibernate is used as the JPA provider to map Java objects to database records.

### Layered Structure

The project follows a common Spring Boot structure:

```text
Controller -> Service -> Repository -> Database
```

* Controllers receive HTTP requests
* Services handle business logic
* Repositories communicate with the database
* Entities represent database tables

## Database Overview

TrackRig uses PostgreSQL to store the main application data.

Main database areas:

* Users and roles
* Workstations and workstation statuses
* Components, categories, and statuses
* Component assignment history
* Maintenance types and maintenance logs

The database also includes rules that help protect data, such as preventing duplicate workstation positions and keeping only one active assignment per component.

---

## Project Purpose

TrackRig was created to improve organization and tracking of physical equipment. Instead of managing components and maintenance manually, users can track everything through a central web-based system with clear roles, structured data, and maintenance monitoring.
